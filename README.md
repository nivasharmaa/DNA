# DNA Analyzer

## Overview
DNA Analyzer is a Java program designed to analyze DNA sequences and identify individuals based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). STRs are short DNA segments repeated back to back, and analyzing these can help identify genetic information and potential relationships. This program reads DNA profiles and STRs of interest from input files, processes the DNA data, and provides detailed analysis.

## Features
- **Profile Database Creation**: Reads and stores DNA profiles from a database file.
- **STR Analysis**: Analyzes DNA sequences to identify the occurrence of specific STRs.
- **Individual Identification**: Matches DNA profiles based on STR patterns to identify individuals.
- **Relationship Detection**: Identifies potential relationships based on shared STR patterns.

## Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O Operations
- Genetic Analysis Algorithms
- Data Processing and Analysis
